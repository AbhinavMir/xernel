> Why study this? Because we are good engineers.

8086 has 15 registers, each 16 bits wide. They are divided into 3 groups:

- General purpose registers: AX, BX, CX, DX
- Pointer and index registers: SP, BP, SI, DI
- Segment registers: CS, DS, SS, ES

You might ask, what is an instruction buffer? Well, it is a buffer that holds the next instruction to be executed. The 8086 fetches the next instruction from memory and puts it in the instruction buffer. The instruction buffer is then decoded and executed. This is called pipelining. The 8086 has a 6-byte instruction buffer, so it can fetch the next instruction while the current instruction is being executed. Now, why 6 bytes? Because the longest instruction in the 8086 is 6 bytes long. "But wait, I thought the 8086 was 16-bit?" Yes, it is. But the 8086 has a feature called "instruction prefix" which allows it to use 8-bit instructions. This is useful for backward compatibility with the 8080.

### NMOS transistors

The 8086 is built using NMOS transistors. **How NMOS works**: NMOS means N-Channel metal-oxide-semiconductor. N-Channel refers to the use of -type semiconductor material for the channel which conducts electrons between the source and drain when the gate voltage is high. The gate voltage is controlled by the gate electrode, which is separated from the channel by a thin layer of insulating material. The insulating material is called the gate oxide. The gate oxide is made of silicon dioxide, which is a good insulator. The gate oxide is very thin, so it can be easily damaged by static electricity. The gate oxide is protected by a layer of silicon nitride, which is a good insulator. 

An NMOS transistor has three terminals henceforth referred to as $G$, $D$, $S$ for Gate, Drain, Source. To create a flip flop (which is a fundamental digital electronic circuit used to store binary digits of data [0, 1] which are used to operate the computer), you would connect the Drain of one NMOS transistor to the Gate of anohter and vice versa. This creates a cross-coupled arrangement. Add "feedback" connections from drain of each transistor to their own respective gates, forming a positive feedback loop.

    d(Data Input) -->|High| t1

    t2 -->|Feedback| t1
    t1 --> q(Q Output)
    t2 -->|Falling Edge| t1
  end
  ```

  Flow of "electron" so to say: In the initial state, both the NMOS transistors are "OFF", when a clock or any other process requests a transistor to turn on, the transistor turns on and allows the flow of electrons from the source to the drain on that transistor (let's call it #1). This is called "drain current". The drain current is controlled by the gate voltage. When the gate voltage is high, the transistor turns on and allows the flow of electrons. When the gate voltage is low, the transistor turns off and blocks the flow of electrons.
